                    <p>Sunshine State Bullies is a kennel here in South Florida specializing in the exotic dog breed of American Bullies. The American Bully is its own breed descended from the American Pitbull Terriers and the American Staffordshire Terriers. American Bullies have come to be short, wide, and heavy with large heads, short snouts, and wide chests.</p>
                    <p>Although there are breeds of dogs that can jump four feet easily, these dogs are not particularly athletic. It is my belief that the dogs are instead climbing out, similarly to the way a human would climb a chain link fence. Research has been conducted on other predator animals doing this very thing, and many solutions have been suggested in the past to eliminate this problem.</p>

                    <h2 class="header">PROBLEM</h2>
                    <p>Throughout interviewing Ardicio Galvao – the owner and founder of Sunshine State Bullies (SSB) – an issue regarding the dogs exploiting the structural design of the kennels was discovered. The dogs, due to their bulky and muscular stature, can utilize the fence openings to climb up and out.</p>
                    <p>The kennels were designed this way – with no top half – for a number of reasons. Having an open top means the kennels are less confined. Fresh air and natural light are able to easily reach every kennel, which plays a huge role in the health and wellbeing of the dogs.</p>
                    <p>The open concept also makes it easy to monitor the dogs throughout the day. Both in person and through cameras, all the dogs can easily be seen and checked on. This is important to the health of the dogs since any out of the ordinary event or health issue can be caught instantly and taken care of promptly. Further, the open design makes the kennels easy to keep clean, again aiding to the health and wellbeing of the dogs.</p>
                    <p>While the design and structure of the kennels are proven beneficial for the dogs, it does come with the probability of eventual escape, which could lead to injury or mishap.</p>

                <h2 class="header">OBJECTIVE</h2>
                <p>
                    To stop dogs from climbing over the fence, a solution requiring fence design will have to be implemented. A redesign of the fence would not be considered as the initial design of the fence ties in to the ease of access and benefits that an open-space kennel provides. However, adding an element to the fence that does not detract from the base design is a valid solution. Furthermore, a solution that does not endanger the animals or places them in harm's way is a must.<br /><br />
                    Various forms of fence tweaks are plausible. Listed below are the options:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Reducing the size of the open holes on the fence.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is not a redesign as it retains the initial structure.</li>
                        <li>Diminishes the space accessible to clamp on and climb.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Securing a variation of an outrigger to the top of the fence.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does not redesign the fence as it is an “add-on”.</li>
                        <li>Provides an unstable surface to grab on, reducing the likelihood of successfully climbing out.</li>
                        <li>Can use different materials depending on the safety and budget.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <h2 class="header">SOLUTION</h2>
                <p>
                    We implore ENC Co. to pursue this matter further and expend resources necessary to resolving Sunshine State Bullies (SSB) issue. 
                    Through expenditure of financial resources, the required materials can be purchased and supplied to each kennel through the organization. 
                    In tackling this issue, sufficient time according to the schedule can be allotted to complete the task. 
                    Upon completion, a safe environment for the American Bullies will be achieved along with reduced stress and peace of mind for the owner as they will not have to worry about escapees any longer.

                    <h2 class="header">METHOD</h2>
                    <p>
                        Upon approval by ENC Co., immediate purchase and deployment of materials will be shipped to Sunshine State Bullies (SSB). 
                        Once materials have arrived at SSB, construction of the outrigger like the one shown in Figure 4  will commence. 
                        In accordance with the schedule, time will be allocated appropriately throughout all team members along with voluntary help from members of SSB. 
                        After constructing an outrigger for every kennel, the next step of attaching the outriggers to each fence will commence. 
                        The final step will be testing and application by reviewing the construction of each outrigger and ensuring they are up to par and perform as expected.

                    <p>
                        Research was done across the web to ensure our team was as knowledgeable as possible on the topics covered. 
                        Of our five sources one was a web pages, three  were peer reviewed papers, and one was a video. 
                        The web page gave us a baseline and gave direction to the research to come. 
                        The video showed how a dog goes about climbing a fence. 
                        By seeing the phenomenon happen we are better able to pick the best solution for SSB. 
                        The three papers went into depth about the breed of dog, how dogs climb fences, and how to stop it from happening.

                <p>According to the interview conducted with the professional carpenter, materials required are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PVC piping</li>
                    <li>Corner braces with appropriate screws depending on material</li>
                    <li>Drill and drill bit for the fencing material</li>
                    <li>Steel cables</li>
                    <li>Bolt cutters</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The estimated cost rounds out to an initial 160 USD for the tools, adding an additional 80-90 USD per kennel fence requiring an outrigger.</p>
